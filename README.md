# Everything-Cyberpunk-2077
Everything Cyberpunk 2077 is a personal project on the up and coming RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, this is a personal interest of mine as i have been following the development of this game now for over 3 years and i'm a big fan of the game developers previous titles.

I was able to implement some new featuers with this website by adding a shopping basket, a item like button and being able to output the sub-total and total values of the items selected

I was also able to add in some video content for this website however i found that origionally after i had added the video locally it was extremely demanding for load times, so i found a huge increate in performance to stream the website directly from Youtube.
This would also be a much better option in the future if the website was ever to scale and a lot of people were to view at once as this would be much less demanding on the server hosting the website.
