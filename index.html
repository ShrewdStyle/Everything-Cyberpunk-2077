                    <p>"I've got a couple people who I've worked with who've done voices in games," Reeves said. "I hadn't done that yet. For me I was attracted to the storytelling. The different versions. It's not just choose-your-own end but choose-your-own path in a weird way, which I thought was cool." - Keanu Reeves</p>

                        <p>'We are currently at a stage where the game is complete and playable, but there's still work to be done. Night City is massive - full of stories, content and places to visit, but due to the sheer scale and complexity of it all, we need more time to finish playtesting, fixing and polishing. We want Cyberpunk 2077 to be our crowning achievement for this generation and postponing launch will give us the precious months we need to make the game perfect' - Marcin Iwinski & Adam Badowski</p>
